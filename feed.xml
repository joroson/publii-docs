      The scenario
    </h2>

  <p>
    You want to add a new server/VM/container to your network and you want to statically assign the address. But, you don‚Äôt keep records of what is where and which IP addresses are assigned.
  </p>

    <h2 id="the-workaroundlessbrgreater">
      The workaround<br>
    </h2>

  <p>
    I have been just copying and pasting in a bash script to get the results of what IP addresses are available. It works but it isn‚Äôt super.
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 -W 100 192.168.100.$i | grep 'time='; done</code></pre>

    <h2 id="something-a-bit-betterlessbrgreater">
      Something a bit better<br>
    </h2>

  <p>
    I am usually working from my laptop when I am looking for a spare address within a range. So, I figured I could use a bash script that can be kept in the home directory and when it is run it will accept some a start and an end address. It takes those arguments and checks all of the IP addresses within. There is also some colouring to make it a bit more obvious which addresses are free and which are in use.<br><br>You will need to have nmap installed on your system/server for the script to work<br>
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>#!/bin/bash
# ANSI color codes
# Green background and black text for available IP addresses
GREEN_BG='\033[42;30m'
# Red background for in-use IP addresses
RED_BG='\033[41m'
# No color (reset)
NC='\033[0m'
# Function to check if an IP address is reachable
check_ip() {
    local ip=$1
    if ping -c 1 -W 1 "$ip" &&gt;/dev/null; then
        echo -e "${RED_BG} $ip is in use. ${NC}"
    else
        echo -e "${GREEN_BG} $ip is available. ${NC}"
    fi
}
# Input range in the format:  
read -p "Enter the starting IP address: " start_ip
read -p "Enter the ending IP address: " end_ip
# Extract the prefix from the starting IP address
prefix=$(echo "$start_ip" | cut -d '.' -f 1-3)
# Loop through the IP range and check availability
for ((i = $(echo "${start_ip}" | cut -d '.' -f 4); i &lt;= $(echo "${end_ip}" | cut -d '.' -f 4); i++)); do
    ip_address="${prefix}.${i}"
    check_ip "$ip_address"
done
chmod +x ping_range.sh
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Then you run it<br>
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>./ping_range.sh
</code></pre>

  <p>
    What it looks like
  </p>

  <p>
    You will quickly see which IPs are available and which aren‚Äôt
  </p>

  <p>
    It is pretty obvious which addresses are available for use üëç

<p>What a strange person. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
